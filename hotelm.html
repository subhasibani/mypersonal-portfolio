    <p>Online hotel reservations are a popular method for booking hotel rooms. Travelers can book rooms on a computer by using online security to protect their privacy
         and financial information and by using several online travel agents to compare prices and facilities at different hotels.
    <br>
    Prior to the Internet, travelers could call the hotel directly, or use a travel agent to make a reservation. Nowadays, online travel agents
         have pictures of hotels and rooms, information on prices and deals, and even information on local resorts. Many also allow reviews of the traveler to be
          recorded with the online travel agent.
    <br>
    Online hotel reservations are also helpful for making last minute travel arrangements. Hotels may drop the price of a room if some rooms are still available. 
        There are several websites that specialize in searches for deals on rooms.</p>
